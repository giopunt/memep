Please read this policy carefully for information relating to Company's collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
            <h4>3. Modification of the Terms.</h4>
            <p>Company reserves the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of these Terms at any time for any reason. Each time Company exercises such right, you shall be required to affirmatively accept the updated Terms, and if you fail to do so, you will no longer be able to access or use the Shots Site.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="section">
            <h4>5. Virtual Items.</h4>
            <p>You understand that while at times you may “earn” “buy” or “purchase” (i) virtual currency, including but not limited to virtual coins, cash, tokens, or points, all for use in the Shots Site; or (ii) virtual in-game items (together with virtual currency, “Virtual Items”); these real world terms are only being used as shorthand. You do not in fact “own” the Virtual Items and the amounts of any Virtual Item do not refer to any credit balance of real currency or its equivalent. Rather, you may purchase a limited license to use the Shots Site, including software programs that occasionally manifest themselves as these items. The purchase and sale of the limited license referred to in these Terms is a completed transaction upon receipt of your direct payment or redemption of a third party virtual currency like Facebook Credits. Any “virtual currency” balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your license.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="section">

Company prohibits and does not recognize any purported transfers of Virtual Items effectuated outside of the Shots Site, or the purported sale, gift or trade in the “real world” of anything that appears or originates in the Shots Site, unless otherwise expressly authorized by Company in writing. Accordingly, you may not sublicense, trade, sell or attempt to sell in-game Virtual Items for “real” money, or exchange Virtual Items for value of any kind outside of a game, without Company’s written permission.

When you purchase a license to Virtual Items from Shots Site, we may send you a confirmatory email that will contain details of the items you have ordered. Please check that the details in the confirmatory email are correct as soon as possible and maintain a copy of it for your records.

If you reside in the European Union and you purchase a product or service from Company, you may have the right to withdraw from a purchase within seven calendar days, commencing on the day after the date of purchase (the “Cooling Off Period”). However, you lose your right of withdrawal if the performance of the services begins before the end of the Cooling Off Period. Accordingly, please note that if you purchase a license to use Virtual Items from Company, your right of withdrawal is lost as the performance of our services begins promptly once your purchase is completed.</p>

            <p>FAILURE TO INCLUDE ALL OF THE ABOVE INFORMATION, ESPECIALLY SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE INFRINGING CONTENT MAY BE FOUND, WILL RESULT IN A DELAY IN THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DMCA NOTIFICATION AND MAY RESULT IN YOUR HAVING TO REPEAT SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE PROCESS.</p>
            <p>(b) Notice And Takedown. If we receive proper notification of claimed copyright infringement, we will respond expeditiously by removing, or disabling access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing, as described below, or to be the subject of infringing activity. We will also comply with the appropriate provisions of the DMCA in the event a counter-notification is received, as described below.</p>
            <p>We may, at our discretion, deny access to Shots Site by, or disable and/or terminate the accounts of, Users who may be infringers.</p>
            <p>(c) Copyright Counter-Notices. If content you posted on Shots Site was removed for copyright or intellectual property infringement, and you would like to dispute that removal, the process for counter-notifications, which is governed by Section 512(g) of the DMCA, is as follows:</p>
            <p>a. To file a counter-notification with us, you must provide our Copyright Agent, at the address set forth above, with a written communication that sets forth the items specified below.</p>
            <p>b. Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability. Please also be advised that we enforce a policy that provides for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of the accounts of (or access privileges by) Users who are infringers. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether certain material infringes your copyright or the copyrights of others, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.</p>
            <p>(c) Elements of Counter-Notification. To expedite our ability to process your counter- notification, please use the following format (including section numbers):</p>
            <p>1. Identify the specific URLs of (or other information sufficient to allow us to identify) material that Company has removed or to which Company has disabled access.</p>
            <p>2. Provide your full name, address, telephone number, email address and, if you are a registered User, the Username of your Company account.</p>

            <p>4. Include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."</p>
            <p>5. notice. If you are providing notice by email, a scanned physical signature or a valid electronic signature will be accepted. Send the communication to the following address:</p>
            <p>Copyright Agent:</p>
            <div>Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati</div>

            <div>12235 El Camino Real, Suite 200</div>
            <div>San Diego, California 92130</div>
            <p>After we receive your counter-notification, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original claim of copyright infringement. Please note that when we forward the counter-notification, it includes any of your Identifying Information set forth in the counter-notification. By submitting a counter-notification, you consent to having such Identifying Information revealed in this way. We will not forward the counter-notification to any party other than the original claimant.</p>
            <p>After we send out the counter-notification, the claimant must then notify us within ten (10) days that he or she has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on Shots Site. If we receive such notification, we will be unable to restore the items. If we do not receive such notification, we may, but are not obligated to, reinstate the disputed item(s).</p>
            <p>(d) Foreign Counter-Notification: If you reside outside of the United States, please understand that filing a counter-notice may lead to legal proceedings between you and the complaining party to determine ownership. Be aware that there may be adverse legal consequences in your country and/or the United States of America if you make a false or bad faith allegation by using this process. Please also be advised that we enforce a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of access privileges for Users who are infringers. So, if you are not sure whether content you posted on Shots Site is being infringed, or are otherwise unsure of whether to file a counter-notification using these procedures, we strongly recommend you first contact a lawyer knowledgeable in the laws of the United States and the State of New York. If you do wish to file a counter-notice, you should follow the process set forth above under the heading "Elements of Counter-Notification."</p>
